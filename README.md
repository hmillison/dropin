## DropIn CSS

A no thought CSS framework for single page apps and websites.

See a [demo](http://hmillie.io/dropin/) here!

Inspired by [Ordered List's Minimal Theme ](https://github.com/orderedlist/minimal) and [Gloss CSS](https://github.com/arirawr/gloss-css/)

### Why make this?

When building side projects, I didn't like to wrangle with styling when trying to get basic functionality working. After seeing the Gloss CSS project, I decided to get working on my basic framework that will let me "drop in" a stylesheet and focus on the building everything else first!

### To use

Link to the stylesheet in your HTML
```
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://hmillie.io/dropin/build/main.min.css">
```

This framework overrides most default styles so things should start
looking nicer immediately!

In addition, I have used Flexbox to provide a simple grid system if needed. Each row is represented by a `.row` div with any number of equally spaced columns represented by `.col` divs.

### Customizing

Will update this section soon...
